# Improved-Autoencoder-with-Dynamic-Hidden-Layer-for-Anomaly-Detection-Monitoring

In this work, considering both high dimensionality and dynamic relations between elements in the hidden layer, an improved autoencoder with dynamic hidden layer (DHL-AE) is proposed and applied for anomaly detection monitoring. Two case studies including Tennessee Eastman process and Wind data are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
